          <h1 class="firstCommentarySlide">“The mother of Jesus was there;” Wherever we are Mother Mary will also be following us. She is always with us, if we allow her to be. She is always hoping that we choose the right decisions, the right path, to choose holiness, to choose sainthood. She prays for us. She is waiting for us at the destination we are supposed to be at with open arms, waiting to wrap us in her mantle. She waits for us at the beginning of the path so she can walk with us on the way. She will never let go of our hand. It's us who pull ourselves away.</h1>

To see miracles, stay close to Jesus and invite Him everywhere.</h1>

Not only listen but to act on what Jesus tells us. We must not be afraid to act on His voice. He will never tell us anything with the intention of hurting our soul. Its us who damage our souls. Jesus always wants the best for us, and He knows how. He is God and we are not. Mary leads us by our hand in her mantle to our Lord, and encouraging us to imitate her saying "I am the handmaid of the Lord, let it be done to me according to your word."</h1>

Now imagine the shock on their face, they could of believed he was a magician, or working with demons. No one knows. But what do we believe? Our merciful God that makes the impossible Possible for us? or a God that is distant and doesnt care about us? He is our merciful God.

We cannot forget the endless love He has shown us. Because of the servants acting and listening on Jesus' commands, people got more wine and were happy, and who knows how many more people believed in Jesus after hearing about this miracle.</h1>
