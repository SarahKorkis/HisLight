          <h1 class="firstCommentarySlide">“The mother of Jesus was there;” Wherever we are Mother Mary will also be following us. She is always with us, if we allow her to be. She is always hoping that we choose the right decisions, the right path, to choose holiness, to choose sainthood. She prays for us. She is waiting for us at the destination we are supposed to be at with open arms, waiting to wrap us in her mantle. She waits for us at the beginning of the path so she can walk with us on the way. She will never let go of our hand. It's us who pull ourselves away.</h1>

          <h1>We Should always invite Jesus to everything. Happy times, sad times, lonely times, everything. We should also always ask the saints to help us, and pray for us. If Jesus wasent invited they wouldve ran out of wine, with no other hope. Jesus was invited and He provided a miracle. He made the impossible possible. He made water into wine. To see miracles, stay close to Jesus and invite Him everywhere.</h1>

          <h1>The wine failed. All earthly things fail us. We cant rely on anything earthly, they will all eventually pass away. The first person to notice the needs of the people is Mother Mary. She noticed their need of more wine. She noticed something so insignificant. Our mother is always looking out for us, and prays on our behalf. Before we even realize it, she is already helping us.</h1>

          <h1>Mary our mother gently tells us everyday to listen to her beloved son. To shut out the noise of the world and listen to His voice only. Not only listen but to act on what Jesus tells us. We must not be afraid to act on His voice. He will never tell us anything with the intention of hurting our soul. Its us who damage our souls. Jesus always wants the best for us, and He knows how. He is God and we are not. Mary leads us by our hand in her mantle to our Lord, and encouraging us to imitate her saying "I am the handmaid of the Lord, let it be done to me according to your word."</h1>
